Neo4j T-Shirts
==============

Neo4j topples the square stacks of uniform records, recognizing the unique character
of individual data and the value in relationships among them. Naturally, when considering
a t-shirt for our community, we wanted to acknowledge each person who would wear one,
and how they are related to Neo4j.

Simple. To become part of the social graph, someone already connected just has to
acknowledge that they KNOW you, offering a succinct bit of recognition. If that person
is authorized to grant shirts, we'll print up a personalized Neo4j T-Shirt commemorating
the acknowledgement.

You may not know which mug is yours, but your shirt will be unmistakeable.
